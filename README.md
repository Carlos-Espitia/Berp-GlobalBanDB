# Berp plugin | GlobalBanDB
This plugin allows you to kick globally banned players from your realm.
It also allows admins of GlobalBanDB to ban players from their own realms with console and ingame commands.

note: I haven't tested the plugin since I don't own a realm so there might be some bugs. Anyone is welcome to fix these bugs. (if there are any)
